 ## Honours Plan
 <b> Stage 1. </b>
- [x] Obtained a dataset
- [x] Explored the dataset
- [ ] Pre-Processed the dataset 
- [ ] Research Triplet-Based DML's from Keras Libriary 
- [ ] Implement DML to get cluster of similar vehicles 
- [ ] Implement kNN to select the nearest neighbor 
- [ ] Apply Explainable AI methods

 <b> Stage 2. </b>
- [ ] Select more datasets
- [ ] Explore datasets and see if possible to combine multiple 
- [ ] Apply a RF algorithm to the dataset/s 
- [ ] Use Compare results of the DMLs vs RF 
- [ ] Fine tune algorithms and\or insights into the AI reasoning for prices

 <b> Stage 3. </b>
- [ ] Build a streamlit based car price prediction tool
- [ ] Build car detail input system so users can predict the price of their own car
